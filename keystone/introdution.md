# KeystoneJS (Node.js CMS & Web Application Platform)

## Introduction of KeystoneJS

KeystoneJS is a generic content management framework, meaning that it 
can be used for developing a variety of web applications using Javascript. 
It is especially suitable for developing large-scale applications such 
as portals, forums, content management systems (CMS), e-commerce projects 
and RESTful Web services because of its modular architecture and clean 
separation of various functionality. KeystoneJS is a powerful Node.js 
content management system and web app framework built on express (https://expressjs.com/) and 
mongoose (https://mongoosejs.com/). Keystone makes it easy to create sophisticated websites and 
apps and comes with a beautiful auto-generated Admin UI.

## Install dependencies

You’ll be using the KeystoneJS generator made with Yeoman. In your root directory run:

```terminal
npm install -g generator-keystone
```

Create your project wherever you want:

```terminal
mkdir my-test-project
```

Then make sure you’re in your new project:

```terminal
cd my-test-project
```

Run the new project generator

```terminal
yo keystone
```

The generator will ask you a few questions about what features you’d 
like to include, then configure and copy all the files you’ll need 
into your project.

It will also install dependencies from npm so you’re ready to go.

Run it in your command line like this:

```terminal
node keystone
```

Then open http://localhost:3000 to view it in your browser.
